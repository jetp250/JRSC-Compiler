# JRSC-Compiler
A compiler for my own artificial language based on Rust.

Currently still in the parser stage, but architecture is coming along nicely. Error reporting works and looks fine and parsing works fine.
Imports are parsed but not actually working yet, though the codebase has been prepared for parallel parsing of those.
